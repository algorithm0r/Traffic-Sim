# Traffic Sim — Claude instructions

## Read first, every session
1. `STATUS.md` — where the system is right now (the 60-second orient)
2. `DEVLOG.md` — the top entry (what changed last)
3. `DEVPLAN.md` — the current `[ ACTIVE ]` stage

## What this is
An agent-based freeway traffic simulator: a looping multi-lane freeway (2-4 lanes) with right-hand onramps and exits, heterogeneous driver profiles, and car-following/lane-change physics grounded in real traffic data.

## Stack (never violate)
- Vanilla JS + Canvas. No build step, no framework, no modules. `<script>` tags load
  `src/` in dependency order (`main.js` last).
- **Shared things are top-level `var`** — including `var Foo = class Foo {}`. This is what
  lets the SAME `src/` files run in the browser AND headless via `vm` (a bare `class`/`const`
  is block-scoped and invisible in the vm context). Never fork the sim core.
- **All DOM lives in `ui.js` + `index.html`.** Sim classes (`world`, `agent`, `observer`,
  `datamanager`) touch zero DOM — that's what keeps them headless-safe.
- **Model/view split:** the world holds state and never draws; the `Observer` renders it.
- **Config:** one `PARAMETERS` global (`params.js`), serialized verbatim into every saved
  packet. `PARAM_SCHEMA` drives the control panel.
- **DB:** the vendored standard client `src/db.js` (see `~/.claude/conventions.md` §4).
  Use `db.packet()`, `db.nextBatch()`, and `db.scratch()` for throwaway work.

## Conventions
Follow `~/.claude/conventions.md`. STATUS is overwritten every close (present truth); DEVLOG is
append-only, newest on top (history); DEVPLAN stages carry `[ DONE ] / [ ACTIVE ] / [ PLANNED ]`
tokens and a `**Done when:**` criterion. `/log-session` rewrites STATUS — don't hand-edit its
`Verified:` line (that moves only on a cold `/audit`).

## Run
- Browser: open `index.html`.
- Headless batch: `node runner.mjs --reps N` (writes to MongoDB via the Server).
- Smoke (no DB): `node smoketest.mjs` — prints the numbers that go in the DEVLOG entry.
